# Heart Disease Predictor
### An Artificial Neural Network to determine whether a person can contract a heart disease given values of certain parameters.

## Dataset
This dataset was taken from  [Kaggle.]([&lt;TextView&gt;](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci))

A copy is also included in the project files.

## Libraries Required

1. Artificial Neural Network
    * python 3.8.2
    * numpy 1.18.3
    * pandas 1.0.3
    * matplotlib 3.2.1
    * scikit-learn 0.22.2
    * tensorflow 2.2.0

CUDA is used to run the model on the GPU rather than the CPU.
## Running the Code

The model.ipynb contains the complete code from importing and preprocessing the data to train and test the Neural Network. The hyperparameters can be fine-tuned to improve accuracy.
